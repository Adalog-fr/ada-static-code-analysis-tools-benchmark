Thick Ada bindings to the
[Lightning Memory-Mapped Database](https://www.symas.com/lmdb)
(LMDB)
library,
a very high-performance and resilient embedded key-value store.

Note:
The bindings are currently complete,
however there are some functions that are not yet bound to,
mostly functions intended for extremely-high-performance applications that
custom-tune low-level database parameters for their specific data.
All the core functionality of the library *is* implemented in these bindings,
and it is suitable for all but these atypical use-cases.
Contributions implementing bindings to these functions are welcome if you find
them necessary.


## Documentation

See the package specifications, which have copious doc comments:
- [`LMDB`](src/lmdb.ads)
  - [`LMDB.Utils`](src/lmdb-utils.ads)
    (helper functions for converting to/from `Stream_Element_Array`s)

You may also want to look at the
[example program](src/example/example.adb).

As well as the thick library,
thin bindings to the entire LMDB library are also available:
[`lmdb_h`](src/lmdb_h.ads)


## Using

Use [Alire](https://alire.ada.dev/):
`alr with lmdb_ada`, then `with "lmdb.gpr";` in your GPRBuild file.

Alternately, add this repo as a subtree or submodule in your project and
include `with "path/to/lmdb.gpr";` in your GPRbuild file.

You may also install the library & specification in a system library directory
and include it from there.


## Compiling
### Requirements

- [GPRbuild](https://github.com/AdaCore/gprbuild)
- An Ada 2012 compiler and standard library
- A C compiler and standard library.
- [GNAT Components Collection (GNATCOLL), Core Libraries](https://github.com/AdaCore/gnatcoll-core)
- POSIX-compatible make(1) (optional).
  Most makes (including GNU Make and BSD Make) support the POSIX standard.


### Building

    git clone https://git.sr.ht/~nytpu/lmdb-ada && cd lmdb-ada
    make
    make example  # builds example program
    sudo make install

You may also use plain `gprbuild` and `gprinstall` commands rather than the
convenience makefile.
