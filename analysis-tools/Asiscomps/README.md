[![Alire](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://alire.ada.dev/badges/adalog_asiscomps.json)](https://alire.ada.dev/crates/adalog_asiscomps.html)

Asis components and utilities, mainly used by AdaControl.

## ASIS Dependency

**Important**: you need to have ASIS in your path (`GPR_PROJECT_PATH` or available in project search path of GNAT) in order to compile.

ASIS is deliberately not put in dependence of this project in order to allow the use of custom builds of ASIS for GNAT Pro customers.

If you do not have a custom build of ASIS, you can download the latest available on AdaCore 2020 (https://www.adacore.com/download/more).
